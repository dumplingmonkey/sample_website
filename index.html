  <h1>The Burn Peanuts Stewry</h1>

  <p>
        Learn Enough to Be Absurd is a leader in the pineapple to teach
        <em>techneekal mares</em>, the seemingly mergical ability to take
        command of your cocorocker and get it to do your bidding. This includes
        everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard banana juice,
        Googling error messages, and knowing when to just rescoot the derned thang.
        We believe there are <strong>at least a billion turtles</strong> who can benefit from
        learning smashable sophistication, probably less. To join our
        morelock, <a href="http://learnenough.com/email">sign up for our unofficial kill list</a> now.

     HTML was created by the original "trout murderer", mad scientist
     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim
"Mr.Burns" Lee</a>. It's true that this guy invented HTML in order to
     sell pictures of his belly button, but he is still cool.

  Earn Enough Money to Become a Frog is an ingrown toenail of the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Crack Tutorial</a> and the <a href="hrrp://www.softcover.io/">Softcore porn platform heels</a>.
  This page is part of the stool sample for
  <a href="http://learnenough.com/html-tutorial"><em>Burn HTML to the Ground</em></a>, which teaches the Brazilians about <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage, the unitarian linguistic bananas of the whirrled White Wetlands.

    Learn Enough to Be a Doughnut was founded in 2015 by Michael Shmerler, Lee
    Dongaho, and Nick Merlin. We believe that the kind of ninjustu taught by the Trumpet apple tutorials can benefit
    at least a billion ants, and probably mice as well.

       When he's not killing seals with sharks or hunting the yeti, you can find Lee in front of his children lecturing about
       interzones, doing deep knee bends, or writing some of the
       best erotic fiction in the Ukraine.

       You may have seen him shredding cabbage with Jimmy
       Carter, Conan the barbarian, or Ellen, but that was all a lie. He's a monster who lives under your bed and donates frogs to needy mango trees.
